            Hello there! I'm Frederik Jatzkowski, a passionate Software Engineer based in Germany with an insatiable curiosity for all things tech.
            Welcome to my corner of the digital world, where I'm excited to share my journey, experiences, and aspirations in the realm of software engineering.

            My personal Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            Right now I am <span id="age"></span> years old.
            <script>
                const targetDate = new Date('1998-02-08');
                const currentDate = new Date();
                const timeDiff = currentDate - targetDate;
                const yearsDiff = timeDiff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25);
                const yearsSince = Math.floor(yearsDiff);

                document.querySelector("#age").textContent = yearsSince.toString()
            </script>
            I started coding in my teenage years (back then still with Python) and it never let me go.
            Even though I started to pursue a career in law and successfully completed the first step of german law school (Zwischenpr√ºfung),
            I never stopped diving into tech.
            During law school I got involved in the tech startup
            <a href="http://inteligon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inteligon GmbH</a>
            where I worked as Managing Director both in legal affairs and hands-on software development.
            During 2018 and 2019 I took on the role of Director for IT at
            <a href="http://elsa-germany.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ELSA Germany</a>,
            a non-profit network for law students with more than 11,000 members.
            During these activities I learnt a lot about larger and more complex systems and communication with stakeholders and team members.
        </p>
        <p>
            After completing the first part of law school,
            I finally started to pursue an academic education in the field I loved most, computer science.
            Thus, I enrolled in a bachelors program for Computer Science in 2020. 
        </p>
        <p>
            During this program I first started working as Student Assistant at university
            where I graded other student's homework.
            In 2022 I was offered a position as Working Student at
            <a href="http://check24.de/unternehmen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHECK24</a>
            which I happily accepted.
            Shortly before receiving my bachelors degree I got promoted to Junior Software Developer.
            In this role I learnt a lot more about enterprise level software engineering and collaboration in scrum teams.
        </p>

        <h2>Passions and Values</h2>
        <p>
           With regards to software engineering I have a deep passion for developing complex systems to the highest standards.
           This includes the application of best practices in software engineering like the SOLID design principles,
           reasoned architectures and well-directed testing strategies including unit and integration tests.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key factor in software engineering are the tools one uses.
            Famously, 70% of security bugs in Google Chrome were once attributed to unsafe memory handling in C and C++ (
                <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>
            ).
            This goes to show, that even some of the most skilled engineers made a lot of mistakes because the language they used permitted it.
            I want my tools, especially my programming languages, to prevent me from introducing as many bugs as possible.
            Therefore I am a strong supporter of strong, static and expressive type systems as
            these prevent the introduction of bugs and even tend to speed up development in sufficiently complex codebases. 
            This is why I really admire languages like Rust and Golang.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore I think that professional software engineering requires at least as many communication skills 
            as it requires technical known how.
            The best engineers do not just write code for the computer to understand, but for people as well.
            These people might be their co-workers or even themselves after some time has passed.
            During my past experiences I have seen some codebases which worked functionally but turned out overly complex
            and elaborated while trying to optimize for performance and/or adaptability.
            In the end, almost none of these optimizations were really necessary and the same result could be achieved with only a fraction of the complexity.
            While to some degree reasonable, excessive and premature optimizations almost always cause more harm than they prevent.
            This is why I seek to keep complexity down if there is no compelling reason for it
            and spend considerable time to find elegant and simple solutions as this investment will pay of in the long term.

        <h2>Expertise and Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Because of my previous experience at CHECK24 I am most familiar with Golang
            and its associated tools as well as database engineering.
            I have honed my skills as a Golang Engineer by designing and implementing robust
            and efficient solutions using the language's concurrency features and clean syntax.
            One example would be <a href="/projects/index.html#hermes">Hermes</a>,
            a TCP gateway with TLS termination which integrates certbot in order to fetch the required certificates automatically.
            Furthermore I used a CI/CD-pipeline to make this distributable and easily installable as a docker container.
        </p>
        <p>
            With hands-on experience in databases and SQL,
            I've effectively managed and queried data in PostgreSQL and MySQL.
            My expertise includes designing well-structured database schemas
            and crafting optimized SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've contributed to the development of RESTful APIs, ensuring consistent and intuitive communication between applications.
            I'm proficient in using OpenAPI specifications and Swagger tools to define API contracts,
            making API documentation and consumption straightforward and reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though I am aware of the dangers of unsafe languages like C and C++,
            they can be very useful in specific roles.
            For instance, I have leveraged the power of parallel GPU computing using CUDA-C++ in my bachelors thesis.
            The main objective was to find fast algorithms for a NPO-hard problem,
            which I mainly developed for modern high performance GPUs.
            The GPU-version of one of the algorithms turned out over 1,900 times faster than the sequential CPU version written in C.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have gained not only experience in backend or algorithm engineering but also frontend development.
            From vanilla JavaScript to the robust type system of TypeScript,
            I've leveraged these languages to create responsive user interfaces and efficient client-side logic.
            My experience includes leveraging Svelte's component-based architecture
            and reactivity model to create dynamic user interfaces with minimal overhead.
            One example of this is the <a href="/projects/index.html#mythoskop">Mythoskop</a>
            which was developed by a team of 6 students under my technical leadership.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Outside Tech
        </h2> 
        <p>
            Besides tech I really love nature.
            This is why I am a passionate hiker, who really loves beeing out in the open,
            from the Black Forest in Germany to the raw wilderness of scandinavia.
            And I love it even more if I share those experiences with my friends and family.
